				<td><p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">       Hello my name is David Luschen and this is my first Web Site, I had an amazing
				time making this and also had an amazing time with doing all of the labs!  A little about me, I was born and raised in Texas.  Outside of everything that Seattle has to offer I really miss the food from home.<br/></p>
				<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">       The reason I am here now is due to the fact that my parents divorced when I was young.  My mom eventually moved to Washington State when I was twelve, and then that side of the family grew with the marriage of my stepfather.  With that, there was a whole new family in the region, that I never grew up with, including my two sisters and a brother.
				</p>
				<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">I made the decision to move up here when a long term relationship ended.  I felt that if I were to ever move up here it would have to be when I have no ties.  I have visited Washington State multiple times a year so I knew what I was in for, but the dark winters are tough for sure.</p>
